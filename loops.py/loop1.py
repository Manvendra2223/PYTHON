   ## (for, while,comprehension)
 
   ## using  iter() and next()

   ##print(next(iterator))
   ##print(next(iterator))
   
   ## iterable objects (lists,file)
   ## also goes to next() item
   
  # f.readline() #read line by line # also an iterable object
  
  # stop iteration error when no more lines to read
  
  # for loop
  # for line in open('data.txt'): ## also we can use readlines()
  #     print(line,end="") ## to avoid double new line
  
  # while loop
  # f = open('data.txt')
  # line = f.readline()
  #if not line:break
  #print(line,end="")
